    "additionalFeatures": "After much experimentation, Procyon Industries has developed a new approach to the air-to-ground attack vessel. As a planetary craft, the Banshee was fitted with economical twin turbofans instead of high-powered engines. Likewise, air-to-air weaponry was eliminated in favor of powerful air-to-ground missiles. These features allowed the Banshee to remain cheap, relatively robust, and effective in tactical strikes. It was adopted by the Dominion as a light-infantry support craft that could be transported quickly. Recently Banshees have earned a nasty reputation due to their involvement in urban conflicts, where their indiscriminate attacks have killed countless non-combatants.",
