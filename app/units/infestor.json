    "additionalFeatures": "Infestors are one of the more insidious new additions to the Swarm. They were evolved from the Borbu Matriarch, an unusual creature that is more like an ambulatory nest than a single organism. Unlike most Zerg warriors, Infestors have the ability to move while burrowed. These terrors can spew a volatile plague over their targets with dire effects, and they have been known to ingest Infested Marines, carry them to a combat zone, and regurgitate them to fight for the Swarm. Perhaps the Infestorâ€™s most dangerous feature is the Neural Parasite, a symbiotic creature living within Infestors that, when spat, attaches to an enemy and controls its mind for a short period of time. Seeing the immense potential of this parasite, the Queen of Blades is busy incubating new strains that can live longer outside of their host.",
