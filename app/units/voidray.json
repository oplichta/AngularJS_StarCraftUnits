    "additionalFeatures": "The reunification of the Aiur Protoss and the Dark Templar has allowed the two groups to combine their divergent technologies, and their collaboration has produced astonishing new developments. The Void Ray is built around the newly developed prismatic core, which serves as a virtually eternal power source. When the Void Ray has locked onto a target and deployed its flux field projectors, it can shoot searing beams of energy that grow exponentially more powerful over time. Even heavily armored structures and warships have been incinerated by the Void Ray, leading some Terrans to believe that it will eventually replace the Carrier as the flagship of the Protoss fleet.",
