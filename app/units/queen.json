    "additionalFeatures": "During the first Zerg invasion, Queens were able to spawn a variety of parasites that infested Terran structures to create suicide troops under the Overmindâ€™s control. In the aftermath of the Brood War, the new Queens are tougher creatures who now play a limited command role nurturing Zerg nest sites. Their new morphology hints at the incorporation of Terran or Protoss DNA, or perhaps even the Zerg-altered genes of the Queen of Blades herself. This evolution implies that a widespread change is taking place within the Zerg hierarchy, a redistribution of power that will make the Zerg even more difficult to combat.",
